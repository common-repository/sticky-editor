Use a mceToolbar continuously while writing the content (as our text grows inside the editor box) for the page or post.

== Description ==

When we are writing content and the text grows the mceToolbar becomes a sticky element, so when necessary we can use the formatting options, without having to scroll to select the text and format, to scroll back and continue writing, so 
when the edit box out of the screen the mceToolbar also no longer visible.

== Installation ==

The best way is always directly from WordPress.
But if for some reason the manual installation is required, here are the steps:
1. Extract the sticky-editor.zip to a folder with same name
1. Upload folder (sticky-editor) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
